This is the read me for Programming Term Project Part 2.

Code used in dbserver.c was obtained from the website cited in the dbServer.c file.
Such code was used to read from a file line-by-line. Code from Beej's tutorial
was used as a framework for constructing this project. Otherwise, all other Code
was modified and written by Everett Tsang.

This code uses UDP to communicate freely between three different servers. When
data is not being computed or sent, each server is actively listening to receive
messages from other "client" servers.

In order for the contained code to work correctly, dbServer and calcServer must
be running before the input to mainServer is entered. This project also assumes
that the data input from the database.txt file does not exceed 10 characters. An
array of size 10 is used to contain all data obtained from the "database".
